# ðŸŽ‰ SSO service

So far, this service implements authorization (registration, login, admin validation). But soon there will be services for permissions and more.

# Running

To run this service or build it, you will need to additionally\
install Task. It allows you to run commands quickly, as the\
makefile does, but the Task provides this option through the yaml\
configuration.

### Installation:
**Linux:**

> sudo snap install task --classic

**Mac/Linux:**

> brew install go-task/tap/go-task

**Windows:**

- choco

  > choco install go-task

- scoop:

  > scoop install task

**Go:**
> go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest

Or choose any other installer on the **[Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)** website.
